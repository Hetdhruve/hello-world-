During My AIML internship, I have learned fundamental theories, programming skills in Python/R/MATLAB, data preprocessing, model building (from linear regression to deep learning), evaluation techniques, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, deployment, and ethical considerations. Hands-on projects which enhancd My problem-solving abilities and prepared me for real-world applications in AI and ML.
